A letter of authorization (LOA) is a document that authorizes Cloudflare to announce a prefix(es) on behalf of another entity. Some backbone and transit providers require that Cloudflare provide them with an LOA whenever Cloudflare starts to announce a customer prefix.

Depending on whether you bring your own ASN for Cloudflare to announce the IPs under or if you want to use a Cloudflare ASN, we will provide you the right ASN to fill in the LOA document with.

An LOA is a formal document which should be on company letter and contain a wet signature.
